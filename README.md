# Line-Follower-Robot
We took this project because generally Line follower robot can be implemented using  Raspberry Pi module but we want to implement this in LPC 2148, so we took this project.

Line Follower Robot (LFR) follows a line, and in order to follow a line, robot must detect the 
line first. The reflection of light on the white surface is maximum and minimum on the black 
surface because the black surface absorbs maximum amount of light and that's why we used IR sensors in this project to detect the line.
